								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><br>Most information is found on the Internet by utilizing search engines. A search engine is a web service that uses web robots to query millions of pages on the Internet and creates an index of those web pages. Internet users can then use these services to find information on the Internet. When searching for information on the Internet, keep the below things in mind.</p>



<ul><li>If you are searching for multiple common words, such as computer and help, it is a good idea to place quotes around the full search to get better results. For example, type &#8220;computer help&#8221; as your search criteria. </li><li>This trick can also be used in parts of your search query. For example, Microsoft &#8220;computer help&#8221; would search for anything containing &#8216;Microsoft&#8217; and that also has &#8220;computer help&#8221; together. </li><li>Finally, you can also do multiple words surrounded in quotes. For example, &#8220;Microsoft Windows&#8221; and &#8220;computer help&#8221; would refine your results even more.</li></ul>



<p>Paragraph</p>



<p> To help prevent these stop words from being stripped out, surround the search with quotes. If stop words are not important, don&#8217;t enter them into your search. <br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>WordPress is well-known for its ease of installation. Under most circumstances, installing WordPress is a very simple process and takes less than five minutes to complete. Many web hosts now offer tools (e.g. Fantastico) to automatically install WordPress for you. However, if you wish to install WordPress yourself, the following guide will help.</p>



<h3> Basic Instructions :</h3>



<ul><li>Download and unzip the WordPress package if you haven’t already.</li><li>Create a database for WordPress on your web server, as well as a&nbsp;MySQL&nbsp;(or MariaDB) user who has all privileges for accessing and modifying it.</li><li>(Optional) Find and rename&nbsp;wp-config-sample.php&nbsp;to&nbsp;wp-config.php, then edit the file (see&nbsp;Editing wp-config.php) and add your database information.<br><strong>Note</strong>: If you are not comfortable with renaming files, step 3 is optional and you can skip it as the install program will create the&nbsp;wp-config.php&nbsp;file for you.</li><li>Upload the WordPress files to the desired location on your web server.</li><li> Run the WordPress installation script by accessing the URL in a web browser. This should be the URL where you uploaded the WordPress files. </li></ul>

				<description><![CDATA[Fighting against form spam is always a necessary job for any website owners as it is so annoying	]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p> Fighting against form spam is always a necessary job for any website owners as it is so annoying to see the submission full of immaterial information. If you are finding for a solution, Google Captcha will be the right answer. This article is about to answer what Captcha, reCaptcha, securimage is and how to make it work effectively. </p>



<ul><li> The most common type of Captcha was originally invented in 1997.&nbsp;</li><li>This form requires users to type the letters of a distorted image, sometimes with the addition of an obscured sequence of letters or digits. </li><li>It &nbsp;is commonly used as a solution against bots by preventing comment spam and stopping fake registrations.</li><li> However, it is undeniable that Captcha can be time-consuming and challenging at times. &nbsp; </li></ul>



<p>ReCaptcha saves the same function as Captcha and it supports two versions. The first offers you to enter some words or digits from the image, and the second needs you to mark the checkbox “I’m not a robot” only.</p>



<p> Lastly, securimage is an open-source free PHP Captcha script for generating complex images and Captcha codes.<strong> It requires you to download securimage and use some technical knowledge about coding</strong>. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><br> It is needless to say that Captcha methods are indispensable for &nbsp;protecting your form from spam software robots and abuse. However, it could be difficult for newbie to install and integrate it to your form. But with Uniform, using Captcha has never been such easy. </p><cite>Sedrik Millwoll</cite></blockquote>
